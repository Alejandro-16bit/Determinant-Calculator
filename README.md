# Matrix Determinant-Calculator
Hello!
My name is Alejandro and this is my final project for linear algebra. 
The following c++ code will find the determinant of a 2x2 - 10x10 matrix. 
Feel free to share and test the code using an IDE or online compiler under your discretion.
If you made it this far, thank you for taking time out of your day to look over my work, comments and suggetions are always welcome!

Cheers,
Alejandro
